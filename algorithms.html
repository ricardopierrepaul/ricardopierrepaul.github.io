  <h2>Full Narrative</h2>

 <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
<p>
The artifact selected for this enhancement was created in CS-405: Secure Coding and consists of a
C++ static analysis exercise designed to identify unsafe logic, flawed control flow, and improper
data handling. The program, <em>QuestionableCode.cpp</em>, intentionally includes multiple defects
such as infinite recursion, unsafe pointer usage, improper exception handling, and out-of-bounds
array access. The artifact was originally developed to compare compiler diagnostics from Visual
Studio with findings from the external static analysis tool Cppcheck.
</p>

<h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
<p>
This artifact demonstrates how algorithmic logic and data structure decisions directly impact
software correctness, safety, and performance. For example, the recursive <em>is_type()</em>
function contains a missing base case that leads to unbounded recursion, illustrating the importance
of termination logic in recursive algorithms. Similarly, unsafe pointer assignment in <em>foo()</em>
and improper indexing in <em>work_with_arrays()</em> highlight risks associated with memory access
patterns and data structure misuse.
</p>

<h3>Description of Enhancements</h3>
<p>
Enhancing this artifact involved analyzing control flow, recursion depth, and memory safety using
static analysis tools. The process required mapping Cppcheck warnings to underlying algorithmic
failures, demonstrating structured reasoning about execution behavior and defect identification.
These enhancements strengthened my ability to evaluate algorithm correctness beyond surface-level
syntax errors.
</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
This enhancement reinforced the relationship between algorithms, data structures, and secure coding
practices. One of the most significant challenges was interpreting static analysis warnings and
linking them to specific algorithmic flaws such as missing termination conditions and unsafe indexing
logic. Through this process, I strengthened my ability to critically analyze existing codebases and
understand how algorithmic weaknesses can lead to reliability and security risks.
</p>

<h3>Outcome Alignment</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Computing Solutions:</strong> Evaluated recursion behavior and memory-access trade-offs</li>
  <li><strong>Tools & Techniques:</strong> Applied Cppcheck and compiler diagnostics for algorithm analysis</li>
  <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Documented reasoning and defect interpretation clearly</li>
  <li><strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Demonstrated how algorithm flaws create vulnerabilities</li>
  <li><strong>Professional Growth:</strong> Strengthened ability to analyze and refactor legacy code</li>
</ul>
