  <h2>Original vs. Enhanced Artifact</h2>

  <h3>Original Artifact</h3>
  <p>
    Local coursework submission from CS-360 (original version focused on core requirements).
  </p>

  <h3>Enhanced Artifact</h3>
  <p>
    Enhanced version includes improved structure, validation, UI state handling, and permission flow
    (included as part of my CS-499 capstone materials).
  </p>

  <p style="color:#6b7280; font-size:0.95em;">
    Note: This artifact was enhanced through refactoring and usability improvements to align more
    closely with professional Android development standards.
  </p>

  <h2>Enhancements Implemented</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Modular architecture:</strong> Improved separation between Activities and database logic for cleaner design and maintainability.</li>
    <li><strong>Input validation & error handling:</strong> Validated user input before database operations to prevent invalid data and improve stability.</li>
    <li><strong>SQLite database workflows:</strong> Strengthened consistent CRUD behavior and structured schema use.</li>
    <li><strong>UI interaction & state management:</strong> Buttons dynamically enable/disable based on input state to improve usability and reduce runtime errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Permission handling:</strong> Properly requests and verifies runtime permissions before SMS notifications are attempted.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Full Narrative</h2>

  <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
  <p>
    The artifact selected for this enhancement is an Android-based Event-Tracking mobile application originally
    developed during the CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. The application allows users to create
    an account, log in securely, and manage personal events through full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
    functionality using a local SQLite database. The app also integrates permission handling for SMS notifications,
    enabling users to receive reminders for upcoming events.
  </p>
  <p>
    The original version of the application focused primarily on core functionality and meeting assignment
    requirements. For this milestone, the application was enhanced to improve architectural structure, validation
    logic, usability, and maintainability while aligning more closely with professional software engineering standards.
    These enhancements strengthen the application’s reliability, scalability, and overall code quality.
  </p>

  <h3>Justification for Inclusion in ePortfolio</h3>
  <p>
    This artifact was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates applied software design
    principles, mobile application architecture, and real-world problem solving. The project integrates multiple
    components of modern application development, including user authentication, persistent storage, user interface
    design, permissions management, and event-driven programming.
  </p>
  <p>
    Several components of the artifact showcase my software engineering skills:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> Activities and database logic are separated to improve maintainability and readability.</li>
    <li><strong>Input Validation and Error Handling:</strong> User input is validated before database operations occur, preventing invalid data storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> SQLite tables are structured using meaningful schema design and consistent CRUD operations.</li>
    <li><strong>UI Interaction and State Management:</strong> Buttons dynamically enable or disable based on input state to improve usability.</li>
    <li><strong>Permission Handling:</strong> Runtime permissions are requested and verified before SMS functionality is used.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The enhancements improved the original artifact by strengthening code organization, improving user experience,
    and aligning the application with industry best practices in Android development and secure coding.
  </p>

  <h3>Course Outcome Alignment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Design and evaluate computing solutions:</strong> Solves a real-world scheduling and notification problem using structured programming and persistent storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Use innovative techniques and tools:</strong> Applied Android Studio, Java, SQLite, and Android SDK components.</li>
    <li><strong>Professional communication:</strong> Improved readability through structure, naming, and documentation practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Security mindset:</strong> Permission handling, validation logic, and controlled data access reduce misuse and runtime vulnerabilities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
  <p>
    Enhancing this artifact reinforced the importance of maintainable architecture and defensive programming practices.
    While the original implementation functioned correctly, refactoring highlighted how small design improvements
    significantly increase long-term usability and reliability.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the primary challenges was ensuring consistent data flow between UI components and the database while
    avoiding duplication and unintended side effects. Debugging permission handling and UI state changes required
    careful testing and validation across different user flows.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through this process, I strengthened my understanding of modular software design, input validation strategies,
    database-driven workflows, Android lifecycle behavior, defensive coding techniques, and iterative testing.
