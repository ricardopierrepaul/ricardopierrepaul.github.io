  <h2>Full Narrative</h2>

  <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The artifact selected for this enhancement is an Android-based Event-Tracking mobile application originally
    developed during the CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. The application allows users to create
    accounts, log in securely, and manage personal events using SQLite with full CRUD functionality and SMS reminders.
  </p>

  <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
  <p>
    This artifact demonstrates software engineering skills including modular architecture, validation logic,
    database integration, and permission handling. The enhancements improved maintainability, usability, and
    application stability while aligning the artifact with industry mobile development practices.
  </p>

  <h3>Description of Enhancements</h3>
  <p>
    Enhancements focused on improving architectural separation, strengthening validation, refining UI behavior,
    and ensuring proper permission handling. These changes improved reliability and user experience while
    supporting scalable development practices.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    Enhancing this artifact reinforced the importance of defensive programming and maintainable design.
    Debugging permission handling and UI state transitions strengthened my understanding of Android lifecycle
    behavior and iterative testing practices.
  </p>

  <h3>Outcome Alignment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Modular structure supports team development.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Clear narrative explaining design decisions.</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithmic Thinking:</strong> Structured CRUD workflows and UI state logic.</li>
    <li><strong>Tools & Techniques:</strong> Android Studio, Java, SQLite, and SDK components.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Permission validation and defensive input handling.</li>
  </ul>
