    <a href="https://github.com/ricardopierrepaul/event-tracker-android/tree/main" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      View Original Android Project (main branch)
    </a>
  </p>

  <h3>Enhanced Artifact</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/ricardopierrepaul/event-tracker-android/tree/enhanced" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      View Enhanced Android Project (enhanced branch)
    </a>
  </p>

  <p style="color:#6b7280; font-size:0.95em;">
    Note: The enhanced branch contains refactoring and quality improvements completed during CS-499.

  <h2>Enhancements Implemented</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Modular architecture:</strong> Separated responsibilities between UI and data logic for maintainability.</li>
    <li><strong>Validation & error handling:</strong> Validated user input prior to database operations to prevent invalid data.</li>
    <li><strong>UI state management:</strong> Improved user flow by enabling/disabling actions based on input state.</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions workflow:</strong> Strengthened permission checks before SMS-related behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Maintainability improvements:</strong> Cleaner structure, clearer naming, and improved readability.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

  <h2>Full Narrative</h2>

  <h3>Artifact Description</h3>
  <p>
    The artifact selected for this enhancement is an Android-based Event-Tracking mobile application originally developed
    during the CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. The application allows users to create an account, log in,
    and manage personal events through full CRUD functionality using a local SQLite database. The app also integrates
    permission handling for SMS notifications to support reminders for upcoming events.
  </p>

  <h3>Justification for Inclusion in the ePortfolio</h3>
  <p>
    This artifact was selected because it demonstrates applied software design principles, mobile application architecture,
    and real-world problem solving. It integrates user authentication, persistent storage, UI design, permissions management,
    and event-driven programming. The enhancement improved code organization, usability, and maintainability while aligning
    more closely with professional engineering standards.
  </p>

  <h3>Course Outcome Alignment</h3>
  <p>
    These enhancements support program outcomes by demonstrating: designing and evaluating computing solutions,
    applying modern tools and techniques (Android Studio, Java, SQLite), professional communication through clearer structure
    and documentation, and a security mindset through validation and controlled permission handling.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
  <p>
    Enhancing this artifact reinforced the importance of maintainable architecture and defensive programming.
    Refactoring highlighted how design improvements can increase reliability and long-term usability. A key challenge was
    ensuring consistent data flow between UI components and the database while avoiding duplication and unintended side effects.
    This process strengthened my understanding of modular design, validation strategies, database-driven workflows,
    Android lifecycle behavior, and iterative testing.
