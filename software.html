  <h2>Full Narrative</h2>

  <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The artifact for this category is <strong>Travlr Getaways</strong>, a full-stack travel booking application
    originally developed in <strong>CS-465 (Full Stack Development)</strong>. The application includes a Node/Express
    backend, server-rendered pages for customer-facing workflows, and an Angular-based admin experience for managing
    travel packages. It uses a database-backed data model and exposes functionality through structured routes and
    controllers. I selected this artifact because it represents realistic full-stack development work and provides a
    strong foundation for demonstrating professional software engineering practices in architecture and secure design.
  </p>

  <h3>Justification for Inclusion</h3>
  <p>
    I included Travlr Getaways in my ePortfolio because it showcases my ability to build and improve a complete
    application using industry-relevant tools and patterns. In its original form, the project met functional goals,
    but it needed clearer separation of concerns, stronger maintainability, and more intentional security controls.
    By enhancing this project, I was able to demonstrate software engineering skills that matter in professional
    environments: designing a modular structure, strengthening authentication and authorization workflows, and
    improving clarity so the project can be understood and maintained by others. This enhancement also supports my
    specialization as a <strong>full-stack software engineer with an emphasis on secure coding practices</strong>.
  </p>

  <h3>Description of Enhancements</h3>
  <p>
    My software design and engineering enhancement focused on improving the organization and security posture of the
    application while preserving existing functionality. I refined the structure of the backend and frontend so that
    responsibilities are more clearly separated and changes can be made with less risk of breaking other features.
    On the security side, I strengthened JWT-based authentication by reinforcing how protected routes are handled and
    ensuring that access to administrative functionality aligns with role-based intent. These improvements make the
    application more maintainable, easier to extend, and more appropriate for real-world deployment where secure access
    and clear architecture are required.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    Enhancing this artifact reinforced the difference between code that “works” and code that is “production-ready.”
    One challenge was ensuring that improvements to structure and security did not unintentionally break existing
    workflows across the backend routes and the Angular admin interface. I approached this by making incremental
    changes, verifying functionality as I progressed, and keeping the project organized so the final result remained
    coherent. This process improved my confidence in refactoring and reinforced the importance of applying security
    earlier in development rather than treating it as a final step. Overall, the artifact is improved through clearer
    modular organization, strengthened access control patterns, and more professional presentation aligned with
    full-stack engineering expectations.
  </p>

  <h3>Outcome Alignment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Improved modularity and organization so a team could more easily understand, maintain, and extend the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Presented the work with clear structure, links to before/after versions, and an audience-appropriate narrative explaining decisions and trade-offs.</li>
    <li><strong>Computing Solutions:</strong> Evaluated design trade-offs in architecture and maintainability to support a scalable full-stack solution.</li>
    <li><strong>Tools & Techniques:</strong> Applied Angular, Express, and MongoDB patterns and followed practical software engineering conventions for structure and maintainability.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Mindset:</strong> Strengthened authentication/authorization handling and applied secure design thinking (least privilege, validation, defense-in-depth).</li>
  </ul>
