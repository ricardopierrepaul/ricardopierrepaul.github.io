  <h2>Category Narratives (CS-499)</h2>
  <p>
    These narratives explain how my selected artifacts demonstrate my growth across key CS-499 categories.
    Each narrative includes examples of design decisions, challenges, and improvements made through iteration.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>1) Software Design & Engineering</h2>
  <h3>Artifact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Travlr Getaways (CS-465)</strong> – Full-stack MEAN web application</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Narrative</h3>
  <p>
    In this artifact, I demonstrate software design and engineering by organizing a full-stack application into
    layers that separate responsibilities (UI, API, and database). The customer-facing portion uses server-rendered
    pages, while the admin interface uses an Angular SPA, which required designing reusable components and
    routing that could scale as features expanded. I implemented RESTful endpoints to support CRUD operations
    and verified integration through iterative testing and debugging.
  </p>

  <h3>Evidence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Link to repo, screenshots of working pages, and API routes</li>
    <li>Brief explanation of design decisions and refactoring choices</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Algorithms & Data Structures</h2>
  <h3>Artifact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Item-Tracking Program (IT-145 / CS coursework)</strong> – Frequency tracking + histogram</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Narrative</h3>
  <p>
    This artifact demonstrates my use of data structures and algorithmic thinking to solve a practical problem.
    I used an associative structure (map/dictionary) to count item frequencies efficiently, supported searches
    by key, and generated an output histogram. I focused on correctness, readability, and runtime efficiency by
    using a single pass through the data input to build counts, then performing constant-time lookups for queries.
  </p>

  <h3>Evidence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Code excerpt showing the counting structure and search function</li>
    <li>Sample input/output and histogram output</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) Databases</h2>
  <h3>Artifact</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Grazioso Salvare (CS-340)</strong> – MongoDB CRUD + dashboard filtering</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Narrative</h3>
  <p>
    This artifact demonstrates database skills by designing CRUD operations that support filtering and data
    retrieval for a dashboard. I separated database logic into a dedicated data access layer to improve
    maintainability and testing. I also focused on data integrity by validating inputs and ensuring the dashboard
    interacted with the database through controlled queries rather than direct manipulation from the UI.
  </p>

  <h3>Evidence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Repo link, screenshots of dashboard filters, and CRUD methods</li>
    <li>Description of database design choices and query patterns</li>
  </ul>
