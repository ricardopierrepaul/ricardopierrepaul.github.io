  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

  <h3>Growth and Progress</h3>
  <p>
    Throughout the Computer Science program, I strengthened my ability to design software systems, implement
    solutions using appropriate data structures, and build database-driven applications. Earlier in the program,
    I focused primarily on getting code to work. By the time I completed full-stack and database projects, my
    mindset shifted toward scalability, maintainability, and security. This capstone required me to present my work
    professionally and explain not only what I built, but why I built it that way.
  </p>

  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Breaking complex problems into smaller tasks and building iteratively</li>
    <li>Designing clear program structure and separating responsibilities</li>
    <li>Applying secure coding concepts like validation, least privilege, and defense-in-depth</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Increasing automated testing coverage earlier in the development process</li>
    <li>Improving documentation consistency across projects</li>
    <li>Strengthening performance profiling and optimization practices</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Secure Coding and Professional Practice</h3>
  <p>
    Secure coding is a consistent theme in my work. I learned to avoid leaving security until the end by validating
    inputs, using structured error handling, and testing for vulnerabilities as part of development. I also recognize
    that professional software development requires ethical responsibility: protecting user data, minimizing risk,
    and building systems that behave predictably and transparently.
  </p>

  <h3>Career Goals</h3>
  <p>
    My goal is to pursue a software development role where I can apply these skills in real-world projects.
    I want to continue growing in full-stack development and secure coding practices while building a portfolio that
    reflects professional standards.
