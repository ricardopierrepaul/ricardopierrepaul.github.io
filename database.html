  <h2>Databases</h2>
  <p>
    This page presents my <strong>Databases</strong> enhancement using the
    <strong>Travlr Getaways</strong> full-stack application (CS-465). The focus of this enhancement
    was improving data modeling, validation, and database integration to better reflect real-world
    application requirements.

  <h2>Full Narrative</h2>

  <h3>Artifact Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The artifact selected for this enhancement is <strong>Travlr Getaways</strong>, a full-stack travel booking web
    application originally created during <strong>CS-465: Full Stack Development</strong>. The project uses the MEAN
    stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) and supports both customer-facing and administrative
    functionality. The application relies on a MongoDB database to store user accounts, trip data, pricing, and
    booking information. For this database enhancement, the application was refined with a focus on improving
    database structure, data access, and integrity to better align with real-world requirements and industry standards.
  </p>

  <h3>Justification for Inclusion in the ePortfolio</h3>
  <p>
    Travlr Getaways was selected for inclusion in my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to design and
    implement a database-driven application that supports a complete software system. Databases play a central role
    in this project because all functionality depends on accurate, secure, and efficient storage and retrieval of
    application data. This artifact highlights my database skills through MongoDB collections, Mongoose models, CRUD
    operations, and full-stack integration across Express routes and Angular components. The enhancements improved
    the project by refining schema design, strengthening validation rules, and supporting cleaner separation between
    database logic and application logic.
  </p>

  <h3>Course Outcomes and Updates</h3>
  <p>
    This enhancement aligns with the program outcome of applying well-founded and innovative techniques in database
    practices. By improving schema design, strengthening validation, and refining query handling, I demonstrated a
    deeper understanding of data modeling and database integration within a full-stack application. The enhancement
    also supports the outcome of designing and evaluating computing solutions, because it required managing trade-offs
    between flexibility, performance, and maintainability. The outcome-coverage plan established earlier in the course
    remained appropriate, and no changes were required.
  </p>

  <h3>Reflection on the Enhancement Process</h3>
  <p>
    Enhancing the database component of Travlr Getaways highlighted the importance of treating the database as a core
    part of application architecture rather than a supporting detail. One of the most important lessons learned was
    the value of designing schemas that accurately represent real-world entities and relationships while still
    allowing flexibility for future growth. A key challenge was ensuring that database changes did not negatively
    impact existing functionality across the application. Addressing this required incremental refinements and testing
    database interactions across multiple layers of the system. Overall, this enhancement strengthened my practical
    knowledge of database design and reinforced the role of databases in delivering secure, reliable, and scalable
    software solutions.
